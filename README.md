# Wildlife Behavioral Risk Vision Agent - Google Gemini 3 Hackathon

This project implements a stateful, ethical vision agent that detects
persistent behavioral deviations in wildlife relative to group norms.

The agent:
- Observes animals over time
- Builds group baselines
- Detects persistent anomalies
- Accumulates confidence
- Escalates risk using tool calls
- Avoids medical or diagnostic claims

This is designed for conservation monitoring demos.
